# Moving

Tyborgs are able to move from province to province as long as they are connected nodally. Each movement takes 24 hours. Tyborgs may also ride an eagle to anywhere on the map after paying a fee to the landlord, this only takes an hour, but limits their inventory severely.&#x20;

Tyborgs can choose to leave as packs, to do this the Tyborg selects the route to take, and then the pack leaves after a certain period of time or a certain number of Tyborgs join.

Within the first hour of starting their movement a Tyborg or Tyborg pack can attempt to intercept and ambush a single other Tyborg, or Tyborg pack that is moving from their destination to their starting location. The majority of a Tyborg pack must select the same target in order to ambush another Tyborg or Tyborg pack. Then, PvP combat starts and if the attackers win; a quarter of the defending Tyborgs non-equipped and non-collectible items are looted and placed in the attacking Tyborgs inventory and another quarter are destroyed. If the defenders surrender the attacking Tyborgs get an eighth while another eighth are destroyed. All Items are then split equally amongst all attacking Tyborgs. Multiple separate Tyborgs or Tyborg packs may target a single defender, in this case, the defenders score applies to each of them separately, but all successful attackers split the loot equally as if they had been a pack. Any items that send the attacking Tyborgs over their inventory are lost.&#x20;
