O-10 are a base of Humanoid Bionetic Water Buffalo. They are optimized for irrigated agricultural output.

The chlorophyllic epidermis is a resounding success. This combined with an exaggerated molting set to the loss of adipocytes, rather than temperature cycles, has ensured that the O-10 can survive on as few carbohydrates as possible.

However, the O-10 can still survive on no food for months before succumbing to hypoproteinemia and can survive indefinitely on invasive growths within tended fields. Although the sight of several completely bald, green, and starving O-10 is a shock, it will have to do until further resources and research can be brought to aesthetics.

This allows the O-10 to enter a sleep phase during menial tasks while retaining their higher functions for use at a moment's notice in the case of an emergency. This lets them stay awake indefinitly.

At maximum capacity, with unlimited access to nutrition, the O-10 females can bear litters of up to 6 twice a year. This ensures that any loss of life due to the outbreak of disease, whether in the plants or the O-10, will have its numbers quickly replaced when production can sustain the population again.&#x20;

While O-10 could be made to be immortal, this would conflict with the limited lifespan and replacement capacity of the advanced and metabolic chlorophyll within the epidermis.
