# The Black Boxes

The seven Black Boxes were the compromise that the GCPDA and the Borg came to for gold rationing and environmental maintenance. All other records on the subject were lost on the Encrypted escape from Earth.&#x20;

What we do know from our limited research indicates that the Boxes are made of some manner of bionetical material that is comparable in hardness to the core of a neutron star. They do not appear to have any entrance, drones and objects that the drones carry simply fly in and out of its surface without causing any disturbance on the Boxes surface: attempts to place objects on the drones as they enter has had no success, the drones enter, our trackers do not.  The drones are also bionetical and appear to be specialized for whatever single role they are given, down to the millimeter, meaning that no two look exactly alike. This has led to speculations that there may be nano-bionetic-bots serving as the Boxe's sensors across the world.&#x20;

At least the function of the Black Boxes is obvious and dual purposed. They exterminate any creature that does not match some predefined list of animals very closely. While this caused no end of trouble and a constant source of limitations for the Cyborgs that were placed on the planet, it is also likely that this is what prevented the evolution of the species present, as they appear identical to what remains of our ancient records. The second purpose is to give out a small fraction of gold to the holders of certain licenses, although it appears that the license images have not been updated. This we know to be due to the agreement between the GCPDA and the Borg that certain more valuable AI would be given enough gold for proper maintenance.
