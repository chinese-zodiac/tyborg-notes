# Combat

### The Basics of Combat

When combat begins you draw 7 actions from your action pool, your action pool is a pool of all of the actions that you have equipped from your weapons/armor. Once you have drawn your 7 actions you can then play 5 of them in whatever order you like, the damage and effects are then totaled action by action. Most actions will have a range of damage on them, this range is determined when drawn instead of when used, and is the same for ranges on other effects. At the start of each round, you will consume a flat amount of energy to either keep on fighting, or to flee. If you flee there is no penalty but you don't receive any rewards from the fight. If at the end of the round the enemy still has durability then they deal their damage to the durability of your armor.

### What Are Actions?

The weapons and armor that you have equipped come with set actions, these actions are used to deal damage to your enemy or to apply effects to yourself or the enemy.

### Durability

Durability is the health of your armor, enemies, and other equipment. When an item loses all of its durability it is then destroyed. if one of your items is destroyed then you are forced to flee. The enemy also has durability, if their durability runs out then they lose the battle.
