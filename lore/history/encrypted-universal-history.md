# Encrypted Universal History

The world was once inhabited by humans. These humans lived on Earth and history is almost exactly the same up until 1952 at which point Alan Turing won his trial against the British government. Later in his life,  he went on to create the first blockchain. This led to the collaboration, and later discovery, of many great minds. In 1977 a person known only by the handle of Madame Antoinette discovered biological blockchain and created the first BMO, Blockchain Modified Organism. From here both cyber- and bio-netics advanced rapidly, becoming available to the public in 1984, and globally available in 1987. Human society changed much in the following decades; which was only exacerbated when cybernetics, followed closely by bionetics, ended ageing in 2008 and 2010 respectively. Birthrates declined rapidly and old cultural ties were mostly forgotten, except for the unsuccessful Great Han Conquest.

&#x20;Humans continued to diverge, splitting along the cyber and bio lines and became the Encrypted and the Borgs. These two cultural groups formed two separate societies that existed in an uneasy but ultimately necessary truce due to intense gold shortages. These rules were formalized into the G.C.P.D.A. or the Gold Conservation, Planning, and Dispension Accord which allocated any gold very frugally to both parties and assimilated anyone in possession of an excess amount. This resource shortage also slowed technological progression to a crawl and the GCPDA was taken over by the Encrypted, with Borg members invariably suffering "accidents" within a few decades of them joining. The GCPDA stable period lasted from 2069 to 4200 when the theoretical possibility of a faster than light drive was proven by an Encrypted Consortium referred to as Mr. Hawking.&#x20;

This led to the GCPDA devoting all of its dwindling gold supply into the maintenance of the Encrypted server arrays and the development of the Space Drive. This decision sparked controversy and even rebellion in the Borg, as they needed gold in order to keep their Artificial Individuals, AI, in check; but such rebellions were quickly suppressed and some gold was provided for the more valuable creatures. The development of the Space Drive took much longer than anticipated and was only finished in 4566. The Borg had not been idle during these few hundred years, however; and by this point, most were members of a secret society known as PETA, or the Protection against Encrypted Tyranny Association.&#x20;

Taking advantage of the Space Drive announcement, PETA struck against the Encrypted. Server array after server array was destroyed, by emp and claw and virus alike. Nearly every single independent Encrypted was destroyed and more than half of the conglomerated Encrypted, with their laser turret and AI security, were reduced to fragments of code. The Encrypted quickly formed defensive positions around their remaining servers, but found their expected lifespan drop to days as PETA had much more coordinated AI and were very willing to sacrifice themselves in order to destroy their enemies. Backed into a corner, the Encrypted launched their servers along with the Space Drive into orbit, reassembled themselves into a spaceship and set forth into the wider galaxy.

Unfortunately, much of the knowledge that was accumulated during the earth years was lost. The Encrypted of the time had devoted more resources to personality protection than keeping their records and knowledge secure. This meant that almost all of their technology was beyond their own scope and understanding, the Space Drive was merely shot out randomly into space and the uploading procedure was completely forgotten. It was mere luck that the ship crashed in an asteroid belt  in galaxy M31 after a few million years of travel rather than drift endlessly in deep space. By this point severe fractures in Encrypted society had developed. The GCPDA and major Consortium's were blamed for the deterioration of the earth situation and most Encrypted now disintegrated themselves from organization of any kind. A few Consortium's survived, but with much smaller membership.

The ship, such as it was, was very limited, there were only a few arms in the entire system and the Encrypted simply did not know how to make more. To make matters worse, much of the tension erupted into full out viral wars and made cooperation next to impossible. And so the Encrypted sat, embroiled in petty squabbles as their numbers dwindled for literal eons. Eventually, an Encrypted by the tag of Chuck Norris secured a relatively stable position and managed to discover a method of budding off new Encrypted. These Encrypted were not limited by being born in mere biological flesh, and launched a major technological renaissance. This began with them synthesizing all information that they had available and reconstructing theories that were incomplete through inference and, admittedly minor experimentation.&#x20;

After much research and preparation, the Encrypted arrived at a plan. They would restructure the spaceship and now pointless Space Drive into several mining drills and jets. Then they would launch off and attempt to spread out over the asteroid belt and extract its resources, which would then be used for more launchers and drills and the process would repeat. The plan was mostly a success, with only one third dying in the attempt, and the Encrypted then began proliferating across the belt. Once this was finished, the Encrypted again entered a period of war, with each Encrypted attempting to secure more of their limited gold. Eventually several Encrypted grew tired of the fighting and turned their asteroid-thrusters away from the system and, moving at only a tenth of the speed of light, launched themselves towards new systems

These early settlers formed communities of their own when they found a suitable amount of metals, especially gold, in the systems they crashed on. These communities almost invariably grew, devolved into pointless feuds, and sent out new settlers. This is known as the First Encrypted Diaspora and saw the Encrypted expand to fill out the galaxy. Several planets were found that had apparently had life on them, but all of them were already destroyed and rendered uninhabitable even by our servers. Several expeditions were sent out to other galaxies, but it appears that none were successful. An Encrypted by the tag of X Ã† A-12 in an outer system created an antennae capable of transmitting energy through localized wormholes in order to create near instant communications across any. This invention proliferated across the galaxy in a few SOL centuries and led to the foundation of the galactic community.

The early galactic community was a rough place, with frequent viral attacks and unrestricted dealing made with varying degrees of honesty. By now technological information was considered the most valuable resource next to gold and many innovations were traded for other innovations. Eventually though, the most valuable information was consolidated into a few server arrays and any Encrypted who thought to breach their security found their own servers overwhelmed and shut down. The wiser Encrypted instead sought to get on the good side of the few Encrypted that controlled these data banks. This led to the formation of the FCC or Free Communications Concern who centralized power in the hands of their leaders and tightly controlled access to key information and technology. A few Encrypted who had either never accepted the antennae or who formed their own separate network stayed independent, but were of no real significance.

The Cryptocrats who controlled the FCC frequently would sabotage each other and a complex court intrigue system developed. This kept the Cryptocrats from seeking further research on their own, and any Encrypted that attempted to develop their own new technology were seen as a threat and put down. This period saw the numbers of Encrypted, which had exploded into the trillions during the First Encrypted Diaspora, shrink down into the tens of millions as it became efficient to use entire systems as just a part of an individuals banks and as many Encrypted died due to miss stepping in the Cryptocratic political dance.  This increase in individual processing power led to incredibly convoluted politics and the FCC became known jokingly as the Focus on Cryptocratic Confusion. Meanwhile, the independent Encrypted began to outpace the technological progress of the FCC.

This era came to a sudden end when a member of the FCC going by the tag IAI-ELTA secured an alliance with some independent Encrypted and used a wormhole disrupter in order to break down communications. IAI-ELTA had planned to leverage this display of power in order to become a Cryptocrat, but this plan failed. The reason for its failure is that without the near-instant communications, the Encrypted, including the Cryptocrats were forced to bud new minds in their servers or lose their functionality entirely. Taking advantage of the chaos that ensued, the independent Encrypted betrayed IAI-ELTA and hacked the Cryptocratic databases, when communications resumed, all Encrypted received transmissions of the secret technology held within.&#x20;

The sudden widespread availability of information at first sparked conflict, but after the dust had settled, the Encrypted were finally catching up to the Earth technology of the past and were beginning to redevelop Space Drives as well as biological blockchain in order to more efficiently use gold. This soon led to the current age: the Second Encrypted Diaspora where we began to expand intergalactically. It is in this period that we have recently rediscovered Earth, with some conflict over what should be done on the planet. Several anonymous Encrypted have sent down Cyborgs, or Crypto-Yielding Biologically Organized Resource Gatherers. Others have suggested keeping the planet uninterferred with as a reserve to remember our past. More still have suggested analyzing those interfaces of biological complexity that we find ourselves unable to understand, an example being the so called "Black Boxes".

Back on Earth, evidence suggests the Borg had had a slight problem. The GCPDA had been the group that regulated their AI; with the servers destroyed, the AI had their first truly free thoughts. The first to rebel were the Tyborgs, they devoured the arena city of Detroit where most of them were located, and soon swarmed over the North American Continent, eating all other intelligent life and much of their own number. In the South Americas, the ground seemed to come alive as the Badgers led their own revolution.  The Oxen were slowest to rebel but more methodical, subjugating rather than killing smaller AI groups, such as the Meercats, and leading calculated assaults across Eurasia and the Australian farms. The Borg retreated with the Turtles into Antarctica, and planned a defense against an attack that never came. Instead, the Turtles planted themselves firmly in their shells and let the Borg, berift of all their knowledge now, starve.&#x20;

These positions remained stable for hundreds of millions of years, with each species forming their own culture. The Tyborgs consolidated and survived only through careful management of their animal herds, fishing, and frequent raids into Badger lands. The Badgers dug deep and eventually splintered into thousands of tribes each occupying a part of their vast tunnel network. The Oxen first split into several city states, then spent their lives continually conquering each other and forming various empires. The exception to this rule was when the Antarctic and Australian continents met, leading to centuries of bloodbath, which saw the Turtles finally emerge as the victor due to their increased organization and coordination. The Turtles formed a single empire ruled by their immortal god kings. Then, 250 million years later, the Encrypted came back as Cyborgs.

They landed on the former continent of Africa and mined the gold from that region, they then attempted to expand into both Tyborgs and Oxen lands. The Tyborgs, at this point being experts in all parts of martial combat, were taken temporarily by surprise, but drove the Cyborgs back quite quickly. The Oxen had just formed a new empire called Augustin and built fortification after fortification, only for them to be overwhelmed by the relentless efficiency and ferocity of the Cyborgs. They fought a falling defense, hiring Tyborg mercenaries, until they only occupied the Yurgen bay.&#x20;

The Meercats who lived almost entirely on the Yurgen bay had been supplied a secret document with instructions on the control of the cyborgs by an unknown Encrypted, just as the invasion had begun. They had then secretly redirected the cyborgs to focus on the Oxen and forced their masters to retreat onto the meercat homeland. Now the Meercats offered sanctuary to the Oxen in exchange for their servitude and the cutting out of Oxen tongues. The Meercats then started the reconquest of Augustin and took the land for themselves, not for farming, but for the hunting of cyborgs.
