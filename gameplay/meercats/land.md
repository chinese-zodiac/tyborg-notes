# Land

### Territories

Territories are the smallest plot of land in the game and are owned by the holder of a province territory.  Buildings are built and Tyborgs choose to hunt in territories. Each territory has a limited number of buildings that can be built without occurring additional urbanization (maintenance and initial) costs, these costs scale exponentially past the soft cap. Each territory has a limited amount of Durability that it can spawn as cyborgs: all variables involved, such as; Durability spawn cap, Durability spawn recovery, and cyborg spawn preferences, can be modified by buildings. Territories also have different modifiers for resource drops based on the terrain. Province owners can conquer each others territories until the province owners maximum extent is reached.

### Provinces

Provinces are the capital territory of the landlords. Each province can occupy territories within a range of two territories from it, which is the province owners maximum extent. Territories with only one potential owning province are called uncontested territories. Almost all provinces will have at least 3 uncontested territories, and some will have up to 6. Special buildings such as bank branch offices can be built only in the province. Provinces cannot be conquered. Tyborgs can move from province to province, each movement takes 24 hours to complete. A Tyborg within a province can choose to hunt in any of its occupied territories.  Provinces are owned by a meercat family (player) who also pay taxes and are nominally loyal to a controlling ducal family. Province owners can appoint Tyborg sheriffs.

### Duchies

There are 12 duchies in the game. Each Duchy consists of core and outer provinces. Outer provinces can be conquered by other duchies up to each duchies' maximum extent. Core provinces can only be controlled by their starting duchy. Any core province owner can become the Duke of their duchy by gaining a two-thirds majority vote from **all** provinces controlled by the Duchy. Each duchy starts in the control of a certain specified province owner. Duchy owners can collect taxes from provinces they control and can appoint Tyborg bailiffs.
