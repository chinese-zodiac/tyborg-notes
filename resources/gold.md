# Gold

Gold is the primary money in Tyborg - not the primary currency, which is Script. Gold is capped at a maximum supply of 21 million and is the reserve asset which backs Script.

Gold is freely tradable outside the game on BSC Pancakeswap and ETH Uniswap. Gold purchased on Pancakeswap will need to be bridged to Harmony to be used in game. Gold is also tradeable in-game in Market structures.

Gold is consumed when crafting certain limited edition luxury items. It is also burned when using certain Bank features which have a fee.

The maximum amount of GOLD that can every exist is 21 million, just like Bitcoin. The emission rate automatically adjusts based on the remaining supply of GOLD such that an 18 month runway is always maintained.

## NFT Initial Liquidity Offer (GCPDA Licenses)

Purchase GCPDA unique collectible NFT licenses with ETH or BNB then stake your NFTs to earn Gold per second.

NFT sales will be run separately but simultaneously on Ethereum and BSC.

### Terms

ILO will have a 24 hour timer which resets for every GCPDA license purchased. The price will gradually increase and the sale will only end once the timer runs out. The final buyer wins 5% of the total deposits. Gold will launch during the sale, not at the end, once a set amount of NFTs have been sold on that network (1,000 NFTs sold on Ethereum, launch on Ethereum; 10,000 NFTs sold on BSC, launch on BSC)

**Ethereum**: Price starts at 0.1 ETH, increases by 0.05 ETH every 100 sales.\
**BSC:** Price starts at 0.1 BNB, increases by 0.05 BNB every 100 sales.

Once purchased, the NFTs can be staked immediately once staking is open (7 days after sale starts). Staking can occur even if the sale is still ongoing.

At launch, the price of Gold post ILO on Pancakeswap will be $4.25. At this rate, $8.82m of rewards will be distributed to NFT stakers over 2 years. Since at launch there would only be 1000 licenses for Ethereum, the annual revenuer per license would be $2200 representing a 14x on investment. BSC returns would be similar since the NFT price is about 10x lower but the quantity of NFTs is about 10x higher. As the NFT sale continues, these returns will continue to rise as additional funds raised will go to increasing the liquidity at a higher price floor.

To support the price post launch, 20% of BNB and ETH are allocated to purchase market dips and burn the purchased Gold.

Vesting and Gold distribution will begin only once the ILO completes.
