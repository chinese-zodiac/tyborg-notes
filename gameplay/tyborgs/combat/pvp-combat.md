# PvP Combat

When combat is initiated, the attacker first does as much damage as they can in a single round, then the defender has a 24 hour period to respond. The defender can see how much damage their opponent dealt as well as what kind of fight this is than can choose to flee, usually ending in a defeat with mitigated losses, or can fight back. If they choose to fight back they also have one round to deal as much damage as possible. The Tyborg who deals the most damage is declared the winner. The defender gains nothing from defending themselves successfully while the attacker gains whatever effect that was listed when they attacked.

In the case of pack combat, both defenders and attackers take their rounds in any order and at the end of the 24 hour period, the effects are combined and a winner is chosen.
