Tyborgs are Humanoid Bionetic Tigers. They are also killing machines.

They have three layers of teeth; first an outer layer of more standard biological teeth made for biting, holding and cutting, then a retractable inner layer that operates as a shredder, with serrated teeth that churn in a circle around the inside of the mouth. The back of their mouth is reinforced with a single large tooth on both the upper and lower jaw, they use this part of their mouth to crush whatever was not shredded, usually bone which they eat for their fluorogland.

Their digestive tract has a separate epiglottis that is only opened when the creature eats a heart. This leads to a secondary stomach with a special enzyme that slowly separates out the genetic code of the eaten heart before sending it on its way. This code is then scanned for biological blockchain and any existing blockchain shards are assimilated. The Tyborgs body then automatically adjusts based on the information that it gleams from this procedure. This is what appears to be the reason for the Tyborgs relative success against the Cyborgs.

Like most AI, Tyborgs do not age past the point of physical maturity, however they are prone to calcification if they are inactive, see below.

The Tyborg regeneration method uses fluoroapatite nanocrystals and leaves these crystals as scars once their regeneration procedure is over. The coloration of these crystal layers seem random. In the case of a minor injury, read one that does not remove a significant part of the Tyborgs body, the crystals flow over the wound almost instantly and the healing process within takes only minutes to hours depending on the severity. In the case of a major injury, read a leg, arm, kidney or other nonessential organ is completely removed, the crystals form a cast within a 24 hour period and the organ grows in from the edges of the cast. When the organ or appendage is fully regrown the cast falls off and is usually eaten by the Tyborg. The longest this process has taken in our records with access to food is 78 hours, the average time seems to be around 57 hours in such conditions. This remarkable regenerative ability has a considerable drawback, however. The Tyborgs fluorogland excretes an amount of fluorotransmitters unregulated by necessity and only regulated by diet, this means that Tyborgs who are not regularly injured slowly calcify and eventually die at the hands of their regenerative system.

All major glands and organs in the Tyborg body produce some manner of steroid. This leads to every Tyborg possessing incredible physical might. Tyborgs are regularly recorded as lifting objects up to 15 times their body weight. The average Tyborg can sprint at a speed of 65 Mph, and can go this speed for several minutes. Tyborg neurology is unique in that each major joint has its own separate neurocluster, allowing for reflexes and coordination beyond the scope of even our own cyborgs.
