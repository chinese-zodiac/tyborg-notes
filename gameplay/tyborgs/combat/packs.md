# Packs



### What Is A Pack?

When in the same province as another Tyborg you can choose to form a party with up to 4 other Tyborgs, When partied up in a pack you and your packmates will join up together to do hunts on mini-bosses or to fight other Tyborgs.

### Mini-Boss Hunts

These fights work by giving all pack members in the pack up to an hour to deal the damage for each round, if one of the pack members doesn't show up to the fight, then it is assumed that they dealt 0 damage. If your pack doesn't eliminate the mini-boss in one turn then the mini-boss deals their durability damage to all of your packmates.

### Moving As A Pack

Leaving an area with a pack, if you leave a territory without your packmates you leave the pack, when leaving a territory in order to stay with the pack, one of the packmates can set a departure time, and in doing so will give all packmates time until the departure to approve of the trip and so joining the trip.

### Pack Versus Pack Battles

When fighting another pack similar rules apply as with mini-boss hunts except that the packmates are given 24 hours on both sides to deal their damage and whoever dealt the most damage in the first turn wins. for bandit raids that can be done on travelers, the bandit pack has to deal the damage within 11 hours or when all of the bandits packmates have attacked, and then the defending pack can see their damage dealt, giving the defending pack the ability to vote to either fight or flee. If they fight then they are given 11 hours for their pack to deal their damage in an attempt to beat the attacking parties score, or they can flee rules for victories and losses are the same as for non-packs, see [here](../moving.md).
