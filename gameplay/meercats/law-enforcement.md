# Law Enforcement

Tyborgs can be appointed as sheriffs or bailiffs, referred to generally as officers, by landlords. They are the same, except that bailiffs can arrest anyone within their ducal jurisdriction, while sheriffs can only operate within their province. Tyborgs can be bailiffs and sheriffs to multiple landlords. Landlords may appoint as many Tyborgs as officers as their Watchborg post allows. Officers can attempt to arrest other officers.

Tyborg officers can attempt to arrest any Tyborg within their jurisdiction, when they do so they may choose whether to attempt to fine or imprison said Tyborg. Attempting an arrest causes a PvP combat to begin, the flee option is not available and is instead replaced with a surrender to the (sheriff/bailiff) option which ends the fight entirely in the officers favor.  If the officer wins said combat the effect that they choose when they initiated the arrest comes into place. If they choose to attempt a fine, all of the opposing Tyborgs non-equipped and non-collectible items are confiscated and placed in the officers inventory, if they choose to attempt to imprison, the opposing Tyborg is placed in the province owners jail. If the jail is full, the Tyborg is instead fined as above.&#x20;
