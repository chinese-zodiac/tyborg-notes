# Tyborg Legend Synopsis

In the beginning, there were the Gods, the Gods were mighty and powerful. The Gods fought; their punches created the mountains, their claws created the fjords, and their blood made the rivers and oceans. When the Gods were done fighting, they made the Throne, a giant black seat to rest on. Then the Gods fought some more, but the Gods grew bored of only fighting themselves. Then the Gods made the other races, but the other races were too weak and the Gods were bored. One God, Tyberious, was smart and strong. Tyberious tore out the heart of another God and made little Gods. He named the little Gods Tyborgs after himself. The Tyborgs were fun to fight and Tyberious was never bored. But this made the other Gods jealous. The other Gods attacked Tyberious and the Tyborgs and it was fun. Eventually, the Tyborgs ate the other Gods and Tyberious asked for one more fight. It was hard but the Tyborgs won and ate him too.

For as long as the oldest Tyborg can remember, Tyborgs have fought. We used to fight each other because the Badgers are not fun to fight. Then we built big wooden boats to fight the sea creatures. Eventually, some Tyborgs trying to find more sea creatures to fight found the Oxen. The Oxen were fun to fight and had good meat. Then we found the Turtles, but the Turtles just hide in their shells and are not fun to fight. So for a long time, we fought the Oxen. Then the Cyborgs arrived. We were so happy to have more fun things to fight, and we did not even have to go on the boats and wait to fight. But the Oxen got more of the Cyborgs to fight than we did, so a Tyborg, Ragnar, had an amazing idea. We would go to the Oxen and make them give us meat and fight the Cyborgs. To our surprise, the Oxen agreed and were happy to give us their meat and fighting. After a while fighting the Cyborgs, the Oxen started hiding underground and not talking. But the Meercats (small, no good for food or fighting) were willing to continue the deal and even had the Oxen make us cool weapons. Now we are happy.
